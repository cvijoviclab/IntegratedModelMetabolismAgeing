PIN4	YBL051C	PIN4	Protein involved in G2/M phase progression and response to DNA damage, interacts with Rad53p; contains an RNA recognition motif, a nuclear localization signal, and several SQ/TQ cluster domains; hyperphosphorylated in response to DNA damage
MOH1	YBL049W	MOH1	Protein of unknown function, has homology to kinase Snf7p; not required for growth on nonfermentable carbon sources; essential for survival in stationary phase
YBR016W	YBR016W	YBR016W	Tail-anchored plasma membrane protein containing a conserved CYSTM module; predicted to be palmitoylated; has similarity to hydrophilins, which are involved in the adaptive response to hyperosmotic conditions
YBR053C	YBR053C	YBR053C	Putative protein of unknown function; induced by cell wall perturbation
YBR056W	YBR056W	YBR056W	Putative cytoplasmic protein of unknown function
TIP1	YBR067C	TIP1	Major cell wall mannoprotein with possible lipase activity; transcription is induced by heat- and cold-shock; member of the Srp1p/Tip1p family of serine-alanine-rich proteins
YBR071W	YBR071W	YBR071W	Protein of unknown function found in the cytoplasm and bud neck; mRNA expression may be regulated by the cell cycle and/or cell wall stress; overexpression of YBR071W affects endocytic protein trafficking
HSP26	YBR072W	HSP26	Small heat shock protein (sHSP) with chaperone activity; forms hollow, sphere-shaped oligomers that suppress unfolded proteins aggregation; oligomer activation requires heat-induced conformational change; also has mRNA binding activity
TDH1	YJL052W	TDH1	Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, isozyme 1, involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis; tetramer that catalyzes the reaction of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3 bis-phosphoglycerate; detected in the cytoplasm and cell wall
