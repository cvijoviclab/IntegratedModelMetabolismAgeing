YJL070C	YJL070C	YJL070C	Putative protein of unknown function with similarity to AMP deaminases; the authentic, non-tagged protein is detected in highly purified mitochondria in high-throughput studies; YJL070C is a non-essential gene
UTP18	YJL069C	UTP18	Possible U3 snoRNP protein involved in maturation of pre-18S rRNA, based on computational analysis of large-scale protein-protein interaction data
YJL068C	YJL068C	YJL068C	Non-essential intracellular esterase that can function as an S-formylglutathione hydrolase; may be involved in the detoxification of formaldehyde, which can be metabolized to S-formylglutathione; similar to human esterase D
MPM1	YJL066C	MPM1	Mitochondrial membrane protein of unknown function, contains no hydrophobic stretches
IKS1	YJL057C	IKS1	Putative serine/threonine kinase; expression is induced during mild heat stress; deletion mutants are hypersensitive to copper sulphate and resistant to sorbate; interacts with an N-terminal fragment of Sst2p
LOG1	YJL055W	LOG1	Putative protein of unknown function, proposed to be involved in the metabolism of purine and pyrimidine base analogues; deletion mutants are sensitive to HAP and AHA; overexpression confers resistance to 5-FOA and 5-FU
TDH1	YJL052W	TDH1	Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, isozyme 1, involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis; tetramer that catalyzes the reaction of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3 bis-phosphoglycerate; detected in the cytoplasm and cell wall
CHM7	YJL049W	CHM7	Putative protein of unknown function; YJL049W is a non-essential gene
UBX6	YJL048C	UBX6	UBX (ubiquitin regulatory X) domain-containing protein that interacts with Cdc48p, transcription is repressed when cells are grown in media containing inositol and choline
MHP1	YJL042W	MHP1	Microtubule-associated protein involved in assembly and stabilization of microtubules; overproduction results in cell cycle arrest at G2 phase; similar to Drosophila protein MAP and to mammalian MAP4 proteins
SNX4	YJL036W	SNX4	Sorting nexin, involved in retrieval of late-Golgi SNAREs from post-Golgi endosomes to the trans-Golgi network and in cytoplasm to vacuole transport; contains a PX phosphoinositide-binding domain; forms complexes with Snx41p and with Atg20p
IMP2'	YIL154C	IMP2'	Transcriptional activator involved in maintenance of ion homeostasis and protection against DNA damage caused by bleomycin and other oxidants, contains a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat
GIP2	YER054C	GIP2	Putative regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase Glc7p, involved in glycogen metabolism; contains a conserved motif (GVNK motif) that is also found in Gac1p, Pig1p, and Pig2p
