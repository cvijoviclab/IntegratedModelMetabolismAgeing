## This folder contains all external experimental data sets or data sets from databases that were used

**YeastractLists** contains targets of all transcription factors that are included in our Boolean model, such that we can map transcription factor activity to gene expression change in the transcriptional layer (downloaded 2021-05-04)

**Lee1999_Yap1_Skn7_RegulationTargets.txt** includes the data extracted from Lee et al., Journal for Biological Chemistry 1999 with specific target genes of Yap1 and Skn7, also used for the transcriptional layer

**chemostatExperiment.txt** data from the classical chemostat experiment van Hoek et al., Applied and Environmental Microbiology 1998 that we used to compare our model with

**paxDBdatabase.txt** contains proteomic data to evaluate the fraction of the proteome that we account for in the model
